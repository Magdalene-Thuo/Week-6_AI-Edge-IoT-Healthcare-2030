## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the Edge AI prototype:

1. Open `model_training.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Train the CNN model using the provided dataset instructions.
3. Use `tflite_conversion.py` to generate a `.tflite` model.
4. Simulate predictions or deploy to a Raspberry Pi for real-time image classification.
